## DB Service

An internal service that interfaces with the database layer (Postgres). Handles all schema structuring and object relations (users, projects, api keys, etc.). This was kept as a single service to provide an interface for all other services to perform CRUD operations on the data they work with without needing to know the underlying storage internals.

## Package Structure

Juno packages are built with [Nest.js](https://docs.nestjs.com/) and follow a standard 3-tier architecture: controllers, service layer, and data access layer. The documentation is fairly comprehensive and a recommended read, but here are the highlights:

- **Modules** - `.module.ts` files splitting the package into capabilities, allowing feature encapsulation. There will always be a root module within the package importing all other modules.

- **Controllers** - `.controller.ts` files for handling and sending HTTP requests .

- **Middleware** - `.middleware.ts` files for intercepting a client request before it gets routed to a controller. An example for this would be logging middleware, where a request could be sent to a logging mechanism before reaching the route handler.

- **Models** - files defining the data used in all nest files, typically taking a proto as an input. For more information on proto files, see the [proto](https://github.com/GTBitsOfGood/juno/tree/ryder/documentation-overhaul/packages/proto) package.

- **E2E Tests** - `.*.spec.ts` specification files testing a particular model or behavior.
